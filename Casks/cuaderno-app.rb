  app "cuaderno.app"

  caveats <<~EOS
    The app is ad-hoc signed (not notarized), so Gatekeeper blocks the
    first launch. Strip the quarantine attribute after installing
    (recent Homebrew removed the --no-quarantine flag):

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/cuaderno.app

    On first launch the app asks for your vault folder with a native
    picker and remembers the choice — no environment setup needed.
    CUADERNO_VAULT_PATH remains an explicit override for terminals:

      CUADERNO_VAULT_PATH=~/Documents/notebook open -a cuaderno
